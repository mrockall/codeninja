# Code Ninja!

## Building a Multi-Screen, Multi-Player Game in the Browser
This repo contains the slides and code for the CodeNinja talk! The talk is supposed to be a guide through the thought process of building a javascript powered browser based game. 

We're going to take it in a number of stages. In each stage we will take one part of the system, introduce and explain the cogs and wheels in that part and ultimately looking at a working demo of that state. At the end of it all, we should have a pretty nice looking browser game.
