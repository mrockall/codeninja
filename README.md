# Code Ninja!

## Building Game in the Browser
This repo contains the slides and code for the CodeNinja talk! The talk is supposed to be a guide through the thought process of building a javascript powered browser based game. 

We're going to take it in a number of stages. In each stage we will take one part of the system, introduce and explain some theory and then look at a working demo of that stage. At the end of it all, we should have a pretty nice web based game.

## Installation
Here are the steps to get the slides and code snippets running on your machine!

1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/mrockall/codeninja.git`
3. The slides can be viewed by opening index.html in a browser.
4. For the various stages of the codebase, use the instructions within the Readme of each step to get them running.
